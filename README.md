# Causal ECN Estimation for Brain Disorders from EEGs

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are severe neurodegenerative disorders.
The main goal of this study is to investigate how the connections between different areas of the brain are affected in subjects
suffering from AD and FTD when compared to healthy ones. This is performed by estimating the Effective Connectivity Networks
(ECNs) from the causal analysis on the EEG signals.
We apply two different causal methods: Granger causality and LiNGAM.
The results show that ECNs derived from Granger causality highlight a progressive reduction of connectivity from Cognitively
Normal (CN) to FTD and, more markedly, to AD subjects, with disruptions involving frontal, pre-frontal, temporal and parietal
regions in agreement with known clinical patterns. LiNGAM reveals more subtle differences between groups, mainly reflected
in the reduced robustness of causal links rather than in their number. Compared with previous PCMCI-based analyses, the
findings confirm the deterioration of global connectivity in AD and frontal involvement in FTD, while also suggesting a reduced
activity in parietal regions in AD. Overall, the study highlights the potential and the limitations of different causal discovery
approaches for characterizing neurodegenerative alterations in brain connectivity.
